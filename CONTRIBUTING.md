#### What is AngularJS's commit message convention?

Type must be one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

in shortly:

- if you want to commit a feature: `feat: bla bla bla`
- if you want to commit a fix: `fix: bla bla bla`
- if you want to commit some script not affect the code logic: `chore: bla bla bla`
- if you want to commit some logic just on demo project: `demo: bla bla bla`
- if you want to commit some logic improve performance: `perf: bla bla bla`
- if you want to commit some logic just on test: `test: bla bla bla`
